# TAM3 - Web Based

This is the new web based version of Ticket Auction Manager. I decided to delete and redo it to rehash some things.

Goals for this project:

- To get everything working from [TAM-API](https://www.github.com/dbob16/tam-api)
- Web-based version
- Also have a desktop app available (eventually, maybe Electron or Tauri based)

**This is under _active_ development**
